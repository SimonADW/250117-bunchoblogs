# Bunch o' Blogs

A personal hobby project to practice and explore Node.js, along with React and auth0. 

## Goals

- Gain hands-on experience with Node.js and Express for backend development.
- Learn about authentication and authorization using Auth0.
- Explore accessibility best practices in React, including modules like `react-focus-lock`.
- Practice safe HTML handling, including sanitizing and parsing HTML on the backend.

## Features

- **Authentication:** Integrates Auth0 for secure user authentication.
- **Accessibility:** Utilizes accessibility-focused modules (e.g., `react-focus-lock`) to improve user experience.
- **HTML Sanitization:** Implements backend HTML sanitization and parsing to ensure safe content handling.
- **React Frontend:** Modern React-based UI for interacting with blog content.

## Sample Blog Post Object
